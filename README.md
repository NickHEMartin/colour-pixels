## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

SmartMask

In this commit I made the first layer in the masks using toms smartmask feature. I like the idea behind the smartmask but for windows users it is a hassel to use and I will not be using it aging because it would mean I have to transfer all of my files back over to the mac. If there was code that was added for the windows users I would use it again though. 

With the first layer of masks it was useful to use this technique, but now I will have to photoshop and recode to fit in the masks as my code only cooperates with 2 different colours for the mask and I need it to work with 3 colours. Now I need to photoshop the greenery into the masks.

In this commit I have added the third layer to the masks and coded that into the sketch file. There is a little bit to do for this project, but I think that the only pixel type that needs improving is the person one because I think the nature pixel and the background pixel work really well to display nature and the background, but the person one needs itterating.
